## Biography

Most recently, I have been serving on a Native American Reservation. I was on the Turtle Mountain Reservation in North Dakota. I was serving with the Society of Our Lady of the Most Holy Trinity in Belcourt, North Dakota. The reservation is located right in the middle of the state about ten miles from the Canadian boarder.

I did many things while on mission there. Some of my responsibilities involved driving the bus and cleaning the school. I also was the I.T. department at the school. Some of the accomplishments I had while in this position were installing Smart Boards in our classrooms, ordering a computer cart for the school, installing new computers in each classroom, and many other things. I was also the seventh and eighth grade math teacher.

The community life was a fantastic and something note worthy. I was one of fourteen volunteers at the mission. I was surrounded by young people close in age to myself that was passionate about mission and the Catholic faith. I was also surrounded by priest, religious sisters, and religious brothers. It was incredibly nice to have those people in my life for the year I was there.
